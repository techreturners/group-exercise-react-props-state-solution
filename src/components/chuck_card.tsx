// ğŸ’¡ You can import assets like images directly and use them in your components:
import ChuckImage from '../assets/chuck_norris.jpg';

const ChuckCard = () =>
	// ğŸ’¡ This weird-looking `<>` thing is a "Fragment". Each component must have exactly one child.
	// ğŸ’¡ As a result, sometimes it is useful to wrap components in Fragments like this:
	<>

	{/* ğŸ’¡ We can insert JavaScript into our JSX using curly braces like the ones below in the h2 */}
		<h2>{ }</h2>

		<img src={'Chuck image here!'} alt='A handsome man' />
	</>


export default ChuckCard;

const ChuckInfo = () => {

	// ðŸ’¡ Note that this component uses an "explicit return"
	// Compare to <ChuckCard/> which just returns the JSX directly like this:
	// const ChuckCard = () => <>... some JSX Here...</>;

	// Instead, this component uses curly braces `{}` and a `return` statement

	// This allows us to write code here to perform some logic before we construct 
	// the JSX we want to return

	// If you don't have any particular need to write TypeScript/JavaScript logic 
	// in a component, then it's cleaner to use the implicit return style from 
	// <ChuckCard/> otherwise you can use the curly braces and return to write code 
	// first

	const someVariable = ""; // ðŸ’¡ you don't need this to finish this exercise, it's just to demo  that JS can go here
